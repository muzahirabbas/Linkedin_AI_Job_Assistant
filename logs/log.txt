Here at Skillsearch, we're a recruitment company. In the simplest form, this means we place people at new companies - but actually, it's so much more than that. We exist to make recruitment as quick and easy as possible for everyone involved. When you work with us you're signing up for support throughout the whole process from planning interviews to salary negotiation. Rather than trying to sell a 'dream job' or finding you 'top talent', we work hard to make matches between people and companies that genuinely fit well together.

Our company is made up of a team of dedicated consultants who work across a range of niche technologies including Games, Virtual Reality, AR and XR, Workday®, Oracle, Peoplesoft, SAP and Data, and we are always exploring other cutting-edge markets. That means even if you don't see your area in that list, please get in touch and we'll be happy to talk through with you how we can help.

We have worked in over 35 countries in the last 12 months alone and alongside our Brighton office we have a dedicated team based in the Philippines for the China and EMEA market, the US for the North America market, and soon to be a 4th office in the MENA region - so when we say we work across the globe we really mean it (although breaking into the Arctic/Antarctic market hasn't been overly successful so far...)

Follow us to see a few of the jobs we're working on, find out which events you can see us at, and keep up with news in the technology, gaming and interactive world.

WE'RE THE UK’S FIRST GRAD & EARLY CAREERS TECH RECRUITMENT BRAND - CHAMPIONING TOMORROW'S TECH TALENT!

Klickstarters was born out of the award-winning tech recruitment brand Searchability, to provide a solution to help connect more employers with the next generation of tech talent.

We knew that a lot of UK Tech companies were struggling to match their demand for talent with the right hires. On the flip side, the tech jobs market is a minefield for graduates and early tech talent looking for their first jobs or placements. Their only clear path to a job is through graduate schemes at industry big hitters. In reality, there are loads of companies out there that can give early tech talent more time, focus and training to help settle them into a tech career that is right for them.

That’s where we come in. We created Klickstarters to bridge the widening gap.

Our sole purpose is to help grads and junior talent get their first jobs in tech AND support companies with the process of hiring and integrating them into your business through our branded careers hub. Our number one goal is to make sure both parties are a perfect match in terms of culture, attitude and vision.

Our team is based in the Searchability HQ in the City of Chester, with recruiters specialising in tech digital opportunities across the whole of the UK.

Whether you're looking for your first digital tech career or you're hiring for your tech team - get in touch today on 01244 739 999 / info@klickstarters.com ✨

Certified Workday® Staffing Partner

Here at Skillsearch, we're a recruitment company. In the simplest form, this means we place people at new companies - but actually, it's so much more than that. We exist to make recruitment as quick and easy as possible for everyone involved. When you work with us you're signing up for support throughout the whole process from planning interviews to salary negotiation. Rather than trying to sell a 'dream job' or finding you 'top talent', we work hard to make matches between people and companies that genuinely fit well together.

Our company is made up of a team of dedicated consultants who work across a range of niche technologies including Games, Virtual Reality, AR and XR, Workday®, Oracle, Peoplesoft, SAP and Data, and we are always exploring other cutting-edge markets. That means even if you don't see your area in that list, please get in touch and we'll be happy to talk through with you how we can help.

We have worked in over 35 countries in the last 12 months alone and alongside our Brighton office we have a dedicated team based in the Philippines for the China and EMEA market, the US for the North America market, and soon to be a 4th office in the MENA region - so when we say we work across the globe we really mean it (although breaking into the Arctic/Antarctic market hasn't been overly successful so far...)

Follow us to see a few of the jobs we're working on, find out which events you can see us at, and keep up with news in the technology, gaming and interactive world.

HR info was not given for "Associate VFX Artist | North America | Canada | Europe | Fully Remote
Associate VFX Artist | North America | Canada | Europe | Fully Remote" with Job ID: 4039062365!

About the job
What we are looking for:

Escape Velocity is looking for a VFX Artist to join the team to deliver diverse and rich content, filling our worlds with life and creating rewarding gameplay. Join a passionate and experienced team that is looking to expand capacity and push the boundaries of possibility.

Requirements

What we will do together:

Design and implement high-quality AAA VFX to support gameplay and art direction. 
Work closely with game leadership and art/animation/design/programming teams to uphold quality standards and anticipate challenges within creative and technical constraints
Translate references, concept art, game design briefs, and verbal directions into prototypes, and optimize performance to run within target hardware requirements
Generate answers quickly to resolve ambiguity, and champion for best sustainable practices


What you will bring:

Proficiency in industry-standard software such as Unreal Niagara/Blueprint, Substance Designer, Maya, 3ds Max, Embergen and/or Houdini. Autodesk Flow Production Tracking and Confluence are required
Strong artistic skills and understanding of traditional art and animation principles, knowledge of node-based shaders, animation, and particle systems. Basic 3d modeling/animation skills for building temp/prototype assets into quick testable iterations are necessary
Solid grasp of game feel, design affordances and visual shape/color language
Excellent communication and collaboration skills, natural curiosity for the bigger picture, and the ability to work well in a team environment
Continuous drive for artistic growth by being up to date with the latest trends and techniques in real-time visual effects and game development pipelines
A strong desire to iterate and improve on inefficient processes, asset management and technical documentation
Value for an inclusive and empathetic work culture
Project experience preferred, but shipping experience not required


Benefits

Interested... a bit about Escape Velocity:

Escape Velocity is a team of passionate, talented developers working at a studio that offers excellent benefits and what we believe is a fantastic project. But that doesn't make us unique. What does make us special? We value the time, energy, and talent of our players and our colleagues. We want every hour spent developing and playing our games to be an incredibly rewarding and worthwhile use of your time. To that end, we are fully remote and support team members nearly anywhere in the world. We prioritize honesty, even when that means sharing bad news. We strive to give everyone autonomy so they can determine how best to work and play, and we care more about what you bring to the game and studio than how many hours you're clocking. We believe in constant improvement across all areas - from the game itself to our production design - and are constantly re-evaluating how we spend our time to ensure that we're not wasting yours and we're all always working on the most important things. Finally (and perhaps most importantly) we're dedicated to building a culture of play, which not only makes us better game makers, but also strengthens the bonds between us all.

How to apply:

Click apply and complete an application along with a Resume / CV. If we would like to move forward with your application, a member of the Recruiting Team will reach out to you and guide you through our process.

Escape Velocity is proud to be an equal opportunity employer, we are committed to hiring, promoting, and compensating employees based on their qualifications and demonstrated ability to perform job responsibilities.

Applications will be considered regardless of age, disability, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, belief, race, or any other protected category.

About the job
What we are looking for:

Escape Velocity is looking for a VFX Artist to join the team to deliver diverse and rich content, filling our worlds with life and creating rewarding gameplay. Join a passionate and experienced team that is looking to expand capacity and push the boundaries of possibility.

Requirements

What we will do together:

Design and implement high-quality AAA VFX to support gameplay and art direction. 
Work closely with game leadership and art/animation/design/programming teams to uphold quality standards and anticipate challenges within creative and technical constraints
Translate references, concept art, game design briefs, and verbal directions into prototypes, and optimize performance to run within target hardware requirements
Generate answers quickly to resolve ambiguity, and champion for best sustainable practices

Benefits

Interested... a bit about Escape Velocity:

Escape Velocity is a team of passionate, talented developers working at a studio that offers excellent benefits and what we believe is a fantastic project. But that doesn't make us unique. What does make us special? We value the time, energy, and talent of our players and our colleagues. We want every hour spent developing and playing our games to be an incredibly rewarding and worthwhile use of your time. To that end, we are fully remote and support team members nearly anywhere in the world. We prioritize honesty, even when that means sharing bad news. We strive to give everyone autonomy so they can determine how best to work and play, and we care more about what you bring to the game and studio than how many hours you're clocking. We believe in constant improvement across all areas - from the game itself to our production design - and are constantly re-evaluating how we spend our time to ensure that we're not wasting yours and we're all always working on the most important things. Finally (and perhaps most importantly) we're dedicated to building a culture of play, which not only makes us better game makers, but also strengthens the bonds between us all.

How to apply:

Click apply and complete an application along with a Resume / CV. If we would like to move forward with your application, a member of the Recruiting Team will reach out to you and guide you through our process.

Escape Velocity is proud to be an equal opportunity employer, we are committed to hiring, promoting, and compensating employees based on their qualifications and demonstrated ability to perform job responsibilities.

Applications will be considered regardless of age, disability, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, belief, race, or any other protected category.

Benefits

Interested... a bit about Escape Velocity:

Escape Velocity is a team of passionate, talented developers working at a studio that offers excellent benefits and what we believe is a fantastic project. But that doesn't make us unique. What does make us special? We value the time, energy, and talent of our players and our colleagues. We want every hour spent developing and playing our games to be an incredibly rewarding and worthwhile use of your time. To that end, we are fully remote and support team members nearly anywhere in the world. We prioritize honesty, even when that means sharing bad news. We strive to give everyone autonomy so they can determine how best to work and play, and we care more about what you bring to the game and studio than how many hours you're clocking. We believe in constant improvement across all areas - from the game itself to our production design - and are constantly re-evaluating how we spend our time to ensure that we're not wasting yours and we're all always working on the most important things. Finally (and perhaps most importantly) we're dedicated to building a culture of play, which not only makes us better game makers, but also strengthens the bonds between us all.

How to apply:

Click apply and complete an application along with a Resume / CV. If we would like to move forward with your application, a member of the Recruiting Team will reach out to you and guide you through our process.

Escape Velocity is proud to be an equal opportunity employer, we are committed to hiring, promoting, and compensating employees based on their qualifications and demonstrated ability to perform job responsibilities.

About the job
Who doesn’t want to design and play games with clients for a living?

My client work with blue chip companies to help their employees understand all elements of their business by enabling people to learn by doing, which you’ll play a key part of.

You are going to have a genuine interest in design, however you do not necessarily have to have experience in the sector. If you are happy to get involved in whatever needs doing, have a desire to learn and a can do attitude.

You’ll work closely with clients, to learn about their needs and handle their requests, so that you can be a part of designing the perfect game to suit their needs.

You will be familiar with the Adobe Suite or Figma as these are commonly used in the process. If you have experience with project management tools, like Jira or Monday.com this would also be beneficial. You will also understand agile development and have a knowledge of UX/UI design principles.

You will get a salary of up to between £25,000 – £32,000. You will also be given an EMI share option, as well as this you will get unlimited holiday and genuinely flexible working hours.

We encourage anyone who feels they are suitable, to apply, we love seeing diversity in our applicants. We use specialist technology to ensure there are no gender biases in our adverts.
 Every applicant will receive a response. We sometimes make mistakes and miss things from CVs, so you will be given an opportunity to receive feedback and discuss the role in more detail if you feel necessary.

Benefits

Interested... a bit about Escape Velocity:

Escape Velocity is a team of passionate, talented developers working at a studio that offers excellent benefits and what we believe is a fantastic project. But that doesn't make us unique. What does make us special? We value the time, energy, and talent of our players and our colleagues. We want every hour spent developing and playing our games to be an incredibly rewarding and worthwhile use of your time. To that end, we are fully remote and support team members nearly anywhere in the world. We prioritize honesty, even when that means sharing bad news. We strive to give everyone autonomy so they can determine how best to work and play, and we care more about what you bring to the game and studio than how many hours you're clocking. We believe in constant improvement across all areas - from the game itself to our production design - and are constantly re-evaluating how we spend our time to ensure that we're not wasting yours and we're all always working on the most important things. Finally (and perhaps most importantly) we're dedicated to building a culture of play, which not only makes us better game makers, but also strengthens the bonds between us all.

We want every hour spent developing and playing our games to be an incredibly rewarding and worthwhile use of your time. To that end, we are fully remote and support team members nearly anywhere in the world. We prioritize honesty, even when that means sharing bad news. We strive to give everyone autonomy so they can determine how best to work and play, and we care more about what you bring to the game and studio than how many hours you're clocking. We believe in constant improvement across all areas - from the game itself to our production design - and are constantly re-evaluating how we spend our time to ensure that we're not wasting yours and we're all always working on the most important things. Finally (and perhaps most importantly) we're dedicated to building a culture of play, which not only makes us better game makers, but also strengthens the bonds between us all.
